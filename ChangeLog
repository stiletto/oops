		sessions will not be broken after SIGHUP
19.07.99 version 1.2a ---------------------------------------------
		listeners (oopsctl - first listener module).
		Expire process at startup delayed untill storages checked.
		thread pool implemented to workaround LinuxThreads bug.
		thread pool can be turned on with -w <N> option. It is
		turned on authomatically under Linux.
	28.06.99

			It was able to lock access to DB in very rare case.
		2. bt_compare (DB) changed from default to special function.
		3. format of url stored in DB changed.
			Must emprove performance. Last two changes lead to
			non-fatal incompatibility with ready bases. New
			records will overwrite old ones after some time.
		4. Now you can create storages with dd if=/dev/zero of=storage_name ...
			During format routine (oops -z) file will not be
			truncated, only format records will be written
			to the beginning of file and size will be adjusted
			( if ready file is smaller then need ).
	10.06.99
		1. regex redirector (url filter) module.
		2. During make install all config files are
		   installed with suffix .sample, so that all current
		   configs are preserved.

		this must stop unlimited memory growth under very heavy load
	ftp:
		workaround for servers which not send "226 connection closed"
	config:
		make install now works
		some changes for slackware(gmtoff)-Ilia Zadorozhko <ilia@kyivstar.net>

	     process answers and timeouts). To add: process all other
	     types of ICP messages.

	http:fixed performance problem with POST when large data volume 
	     attached to request (file uploads using POST) were first slowly
	     read to memory and then sent. Fixed possible bof when reading
	     chunk size, always send HTTP/1.0 to 1.0 clients when sending
	     doc, received by request of 1.1 client.
	other: minor decorations (version file, DB_VERSION_STRING...)
