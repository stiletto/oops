		linuxthreads deadlock workaround
		using workers threads
28.06.99 version 1.1 ----------------------------------------------
	22.06.99
		some performance emprovements: bt_pagesize=16k, instead
		of default 8k, WRLOCK_DB moved out of loop in clean_disk.c
	18.06.99
		poll() support added. fixed bug in clean_disk.c (close cursor
		on closed base).
		"feature" in Redhat 6.0x linux workaround: "Connection reset by
		server" message in browser(http_utils.c) in POST requests.
	14.06.99
		pread/pwrite used to access storages on systems with support.
		this will save lot of lseek() calls.
	13.06.99
		1.bug in clean_disk.c fixed (UNLOCK_DB without LOCK_DB).
			It was able to lock access to DB in very rare case.
		2. bt_compare (DB) changed from default to special function.
		3. format of url stored in DB changed.
			Must emprove performance. Last two changes lead to
			non-fatal incompatibility with ready bases. New
			records will overwrite old ones after some time.
		4. Now you can create storages with dd if=/dev/zero of=storage_name ...
			During format routine (oops -z) file will not be
			truncated, only format records will be written
			to the beginning of file and size will be adjusted
			( if ready file is smaller then need ).
	10.06.99
		1. regex redirector (url filter) module.
		2. During make install all config files are
		   installed with suffix .sample, so that all current
		   configs are preserved.
	31.05.99

		For FreeBSD 2.2.7+ setsockopt(TCP_NODELAY) was excluded
14.04.99 version 1.0b -------------------------------------------------

		some changes for slackware(gmtoff)-Ilia Zadorozhko <ilia@kyivstar.net>

	     types of ICP messages.

	http:fixed performance problem with POST when large data volume 
	     attached to request (file uploads using POST) were first slowly
	     read to memory and then sent. Fixed possible bof when reading

	     doc, received by request of 1.1 client.
	other: minor decorations (version file, DB_VERSION_STRING...)
