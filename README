oops - http caching proxy server written with performance as primary goal

It's main features

1) fast start. It is ready to serve requests immediately after start.
   On-disk storages are checked in background, while serving requests
   directly from network.

2) stable operation.

3) clean reconfiguration on SIGHUP - no broken sessions, new settings
   applied to new connections.

4) easy-to-read/understand config file and acl's

5) modular structure. Several module types exist: logging, access, output,
   error reporting, URL filtering, ....

6) objects are stored in large files: no file per object scheme.
   these large files can be raw devices.

7) HTTP/1.1 (without persistent connections yet)
