oops - http caching proxy server written with performance as primary goal

It's main fetures

1) fast start. It is ready to serve requests immediately after start,
   check on-disk storages in background, while serving requests directly from
   network.

2) stable operation. I didn't see it core dumped over last few monthes.

3) clean reconfiguration on SIGHUP - no broken sessions, new settings
   applyed to new connections.

4) easy-to-read/understand config file and acl's

5) modular structure. Several module types exist: logging, access, output,
   error reporting.

6) objects are stored in large files: no file per object scheme.
   these large files can be raw devices.
