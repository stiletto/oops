General procedure:

Known problems:
1) linux - Don't use MIT_PTHREADS. Use LinuxThreads and glibc later
   than 2.0.7-19. Wrong thread library manifest itself in broken
   connections.
   Latest RedHat comes with right libraries. If you
   have any info re other Linux distributions, please, send me info.
