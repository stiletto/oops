General procedure:

1) ./configure

2) make install

3) cd /usr/local/oops (or whatever you choose with --prefix= during configure)

4) vi oops.cfg - change settings (nameservers, path to storages, acl, peers,...)

5) ./oops -z -c oops.cfg - format storages.

6) ./oops -c oops.cfg    - run proxy


Known problems:

1) linux - Don't use MIT_PTHREADS. Use LinuxThreads and glibc later
   than 2.0.7-19. Wrong thread library manifest itself in broken
   connections.
   Latest RedHat comes with right libraries. If you
   have any info re other Linux distributions, please, send me info.

2) FreeBSD - don't use old libdb which is supplied with new FreeBSD (3.x) -
   use DB from Sleepycat.
   This programm can hang under old versions of FreeBSD (prior to 3.3)


To build FreeBSD port use next configure options:

./configure --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc/oops 
	    --localstatedir=/var/run --libdir=/usr/local/libexec/oops

Then: executables oops and oopsctl will be in /usr/local/sbin,
oops.cfg, tables, templates, rules will be in /usr/local/etc/oops,
oops.pid in /var/run,
modules in /usr/local/etc/oops,
in /usr/local/oops you will have directories logs/, storages/, DB/
