<ul>
<li><b>nameserver</b><br>
	There are functions of gethostbyname family that are commonly used to
	translate host names into addresses (please note that OOPS tries to avoid to call
	them, soon it will be clear why). These functions are useful for several
	reasons. First gethostbyname() allows you to use not only DNS as information
	source, but also NIS, file /etc/hosts, and so on. Unfortunately gethostbyname() and
	its thread-safe variant gethostbyname_r() can be serious bottleneck if you
	need to resolve several names in parallel: all names will be resolved
	one by one in sequence. That is why OOPS uses its own internal simple
	resolver. As for today it can perform only name-to-address translation 
	and it needs nameserver, to which it sends requests.
	<br>

	You can have several lines with 'nameserver' keyword. All requests will be
	sent to all of them in round-robin fashion starting from the first. After
	sending request to first nameserver we make a small pause (hoping that the first
	nameserver answers and we don't need to send further requests to the
	nameservers). If we don't receive an answer, then we periodically (with
	increased interval) send requests to all nameservers. Successful answers
	are cached for half an hour, so the nameservers will not be highly loaded.
	<br>

	Lines 'nameserver' can be omitted from config. In that case we will use
	gethostname().
	<br>

<li><b>bind</b><br>
	This is an IP address where we can listen for HTTP proxy requests. If the host, where
	OOPS runs has several interfaces (or aliases), then by default it will
	accept connections to all of these addresses. Sometimes this is not what you
	need. In this case you can place the address (or name), on which OOPS must accept
	connection in the 'bind' instruction. Note, if for some reason binding to
	this address fails (invalid address, no such interface), this option
	will be ignored and OOPS will listen on all addresses.
	<br>

<li><b>http_port</b><br>
	This is a port number where OOPS accepts HTTP requests. If this line is
	omitted, then OOPS will listen on default port 3128. Port can have value 0
	in which case it does not work as a HTTP proxy. Option 'bind' has relation with
	this option - it defines on which address OOPS accepts connection.
	<br>

<li><b>icp_port</b><br>
	This is the port number where OOPS accepts ICP requests.
	<br>

<li><b>connect-from</b><br>
	If you omit this option then during connection to HTTP server OOPS doesn't
	try to bind the local end of connection to any address. This may not be useful:
	for example your proxy server has two addresses on ethernet interface and
	first name resolves in some name NOT in the form proxy.yourdomain.tld. In
	this case all outbound connections will probably be set up from improper
	name. To correct this situation use option 'connect-from' - it will tie
	local end of outbound connections to fixed address.
	<br>

<li><b>bind_acl</b><br>
	This is the more flexible variant of the previous directive. It works as
	the following:
	if the request matches the ACL list then it binds it to specified address.
	<br>

	There can be several such directives, each request passes over all of them
	until the first match. If no match is found, OOPS will use directive
	'connect-from' (if present).
	<br>

	What can you use this for? For example you have several uplinks (I don't talk
	about peers, just uplink provider) and you would like to balance a downstream
	flow produced by your proxy. You can bind the local end of some outbound
	requests to the IP address from one network, and the other - to another network. Then
	the answers will go on different pathes.
	<br>

<li><b>lo_mark</b><br>
	OOPS has a two-level cache: 1) in-memory cache and 2) on-disk cache. During request
	processing we look up the document in memory first, then (in case of failure) -
	on disk. Any new document is first placed in memory cache, from which at
	some stage it can be swapped on the disk. After the start of the program, the total
	volume of the cached documents starts to grow. 'lo_mark' puts limit on this growth.
	When this limit is reached the documents starts to go to the disk and frees
	the memory. This process continues untill the total volume of documents in the memory
	returns below the in limit. By the way, if you run OOPS for 10 minutes and
	it loads 10 documents, then most probably you will not see anything on the disk.
	Note also that "total document volume" doesn't mean "program size in memory".
	In stable state the program size in memory is always more then lo_mark, and
	depends on the load, your malloc() behaviour and some other parameters.
	<br>

	Accounting for total volume occurs once per 10 seconds.
	<br>

	So, think about lo_mark only as a "hint" to the program size in memory.
	<br>

<li><b>mem_max</b><br>
	This is also a limit. Under heavy load, the speed of the filling of memory cache may
	become larger than the speed of the swap-out process, and this can lead to infinite
	growth in memory. mem_max can stop this growth: if total document volume
	becomes larger than mem_max documents will be destroyed instead of being swapped out.
	This continues till the volume returns to mem_max. This is a rare case
	if you have fast disks and too much load, so you can safely set
	mem_max=2*lo_mark. So lo_mark MUST be less then mem_max.
	<br>

<li><b>userid</b><br>
	Although security was taken very seriously into account, you can
	believe in success of or not. Almost right after start, OOPS can switch to
	unprivileged user id, so that breakthrough will not be dangerous. You can
	omit this option, in which case OOPS will continue to run under UID from
	which it was started.
	<br>

	Using this directive lead to some limits on reconfigure process: for example
	you will not be able to open new privileged port (<1024).
	<br>

	If you use this option it is *very important* that user has all the needed access
	privileges to files which OOPS uses.
	<br>

	It is also important that OOPS starts with root privileges. This allows the
	automatic removal of some limits on resource usage: number of open files,
	memory size, and etc. If you don't start OOPS with root privileges it
	will not be able to remove the limits and this can quickly lead to problems.
	<br>

<li><b>stop_cache</b><br>
	This is the easiest (and fastest) way to control document cache ability. If you place
	this instruction in config, then all requests are subjects to following test:
	is the string that is a parameter of this stop_cache directive the
	substring of the request URL path? If yes, then this document will not be
	cached. Example: 'stop_cache ?' will stop caching any document with URL
	'http://hostname/path?request'. ATTENTION: only the path is subject to this
	comparison.
	<br>

<li><b>local_domain</b><br>
	In case you have any cache hierarchy, 'local_domain' states that some domains
	are local for you, and in all cases requests to these domains must be served
	directly.
	<br>

<li><b>local_networks</b><br>
	This is almost the same as the local_domain but here networks are listed instead of
	domains. If you use this directive then all requests (even if served
	from parent) will lead to name resolving.
	<br>

<li><b>default_expire_value</b><br>
	If the document doesn't contain Expire: header and we can't find any
	other source of expiration time information, then OOPS sets the expiration date
	using this option. Other options that take part in this process are:
	refresh_pattern, max-expire-value and last-modified-factor.
	<br>

<li><b>refresh_pattern</b><br>
	This option is used in case you want to force some documents to have some
	expiration date that have higher preference then any other expiration date
	information. This option has 4 parameters: ACLNAME, min, percent, max.
	ACLNAME - name of ACL used to separate documents of our interest. min and
	max - minimal and maximal expiration time correspondently (in seconds).
	percent is an amount in which Last-Modification time is taken into consideration
	(if the document changed recently, then probably it will change again soon).
	We take 'percent' into account only in case the document doesn't have Expire:
	header and works as the following: we calculate the time passed since last modification,
	we take the percent of this value and expiration date to that number of
	seconds in future.
	<br>

<li><b>disk_low_free, disk_ok_free</b><br>
	These parameters control the "storage cleanup" process. Once per 10 seconds
	we check for total free space on storages. If this volume becomes lower then
	disk_low_free percents, then cleanup begins. It continues till the free space
	returns to disk_ok_free, or some event interrupt cleanup (reconfigure
	or shutdown).

<li><b>force_http11</b><br>
	This option turns version conversion from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 during the request
	to server.

<li><b>always_check_freshness  and always_check_freshness_acl</b><br>
	This option forces the checking of freshness of documents in cache before sending
	answer to client. always_check_freshness forces to check each document,
	always_check_freshness_acl forces to check only the documents that fall into
	the mentioned ACLs. If none of this options are present in config, OOPS will
	check document freshness only if the user requests or the document expires.

<li><b>force_completion</b><br>
	If the user, requested some documents, and  decided to stop the download, and no other client
	downloads this document at the same time, OOPS can break the loading of this
	document from the server. On the hand this can save inbound capacity because OOPS will not
	receive that are not needed. On the other hand, this document can be useful
	later and some parts of your incoming bandwidth can already be used to download parts
	of the document. In this case you can decide if it is better to continue
	the document loading. force_completion defines the threshold; which path of the document
	must be downloaded before, so that even if the user refuses to continue the download,
	the document will be loaded completely.

<li><b>insert_x_forwarded_for, insert_via</b><br>
	HTTP headers X-Forwarded-For and "Via:" will be/won't be inserted in answers
	if you choose use options "yes" or "no".

<li><b>acl</b><br>
	It defines the named ACL. Descriptions are intuitive in most cases. See oops.cfg
	for examples.

<li><b>acl_deny</b><br>
	It denies requests that satisfy ACL's, listed here.

<li><b>parent</b><br>
	Using this instruction you can almost completely stop direct connections to
	the servers. All requests will be routed to this parent. Some requests are still
	routed directly to http server: requests which satisfy local_domain or
	local-networks statements. You can use this instruction if you have a single
	uplink or a single, stable, fast neighbour. For all other options for neighbour
	interactions, see section <b>peer</b>.

<li><b>parent_auth</b><br>
	If the parent, described in the previous section requires a login/password,
	it can be set here.

<li><b>peer</b><br>
	This section describes your neighbours in cache hierarchy. OOPS can interact
	with peers using (and not using) ICP. The parameters of this instruction are:
	name or IP address of neighbour, his http-port, and his icp-port, followed by
	other parameters and properties of the peer. The HTTP-port is a port where the peers
	listen for http requests, the ICP-port is a port where the peers listen for ICP
	requests. The ICP port can be 0. This will slightly change the algorithm of the
	peer interaction (see below).

    <ul>
    <li>sibling|parent<br>
	This option defines who is this neighbour for. "parent" allows you to fetch
	documents even if they are not in his cache - so that he will receive
	documents from the network for you. "sibling" will not allow you to fetch
	documents from it if it doesn't have it in cache. So, this is more an
	administrative solution, then technical. It is better to ask the peer
	administrator how you should describe it.

    <li>my_auth<br>
	This option must be used if your peer require authentication.

    <li>allow|deny<br>
	With these options you can control the requests to be routed through
	this peer. Here you can list domains. You can also use a more flexible option
	peer_access.

    <li>peer_access<br>
	This option can be used for fine tuning of the requests to be served
	through this peer. There can be several such lines, and you can use any ACL's
	here (with or without '!').

    <li>down_timeout<br>
	This option has a meaning only in case of non-ICP peer (icp-port is equal
	to 0). In this case we interact with the peer in the following way: we don't send ICP
	requests, instead, we assume that the peer always replies 'MISS'. This means that
	if any peers (we already sent requests to) answer HIT, then we will
	route the request to that ('HIT'-ed peer). For a non-icp peer we can only check
	peer status by sending him HTTP-request, the algorithm of UP/DOWN
	transition is the following: if any HTTP connection to peer fails,
	this peer goes to DOWN state and it will be excluded from any
	considerations for down_timeout seconds. After that time it will go to UP
	state again.
     </ul>
<li><b>group</b><br>

	All users or their requests will fall into some groups. Almost all aspects
	of services for requests are described in the 'group' section. The decision of
	which group this request belongs to, is made as the following:<br>

	If in the group's description you placed 'networks_acl' option, then
	first try to detect the proper group by applying all networks ACLs (in the
	order to be seen in config) to the request. At the first match we stop the lookup. If
	you have no networks_acl in oops.cfg, or the lookup failed, then try
	'networks'. All network addresses, listed in 'networks' directives are
	sorted so that most specific (mask length is longer) addresses are looked
	first. If the client address falls in any network, then the request falls into the group
	where this network was described.

    <ul>
	<li>networks<br>
	This is a list of all hosts and networks which belong to this group. Networks
	are presented in form aaa.bbb.ccc/length. For hosts mask length equals to 32.
	    
	<li>networks_acl<br>
	If the request matches this ACL, then it belongs to this group.

	<li>badports<br>
	A list of ports which are denied for the given group.
	Use ports from example and expand it.


	<li>miss allow|deny<br>
	This option controls the access to your cache from the neighbours. If you
	set 'deny', then all requests to the document that aren't in cache will be failed.
	You can set up groups for all your neighbours.

	<li>denytime<br>
	Time intervals when requests from this group will be denied.
	THE Parameter has the following forms:<br>

	days-list time_from:time_to<br>

	days-list - comma-separated days or day intervals (for example Thu:Fri). Pay
	attention: interval must be ascending (days order: Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat)

	<li>auth_mods<br>
	The module which will authorize the users in this group (if needed).

	<li>redir_mods<br>
	Modules-redirectors, which handle the requests from this group. 
	If some of them are listed, they will be called in the selected order.

	<li>bandwidth<br>
	Bandwidth (in bytes per second) for this group. 
	This parameter limits the amount of data per second transmitted to all
	users in this group. Traffic evaluation takes place once in a second,
	that can lead to inaccuracy. High quality shaping can only be achieved
	at high rate sampling, but this can lead to large overhead.

	<li>per_ip_bw<br>
	This is analogous to the previous limit, but the limit is
	placed on the flow to each host in group. Both limits can be
	applied.

	<li>per_ip_conn<br>
	The maximum number of connections which can be opened
	from every single host in the group.

	<li>maxreqrate<br>
	The maximum total request rate acceptable for this group.

	<li>http<br>
	This is the oldest form of domain access restrictions. In the 'allow' section
	list all domains that are allowed (you can use * in place of domain name),
	in 'deny' section list all domains that must be denied.

	<li>icp<br>
	Do nothing.

</ul>

	<li><b>storage</b><br>
	This section describes storages. Storage is a single file, which stores
	documents. File can be "regular" or disk "character" device. Storage must be
	formatted (oops -z) before use. OOPS can work without storages.<br>

	Parameters of the storages are:

	<ul>
	<li>path - name of the file.

	<li>size<br>
	Size of the storage. Used only during the format process. size can accept
	any values (not less then several KB). Usage of large storages (larger then
	2G) require option --enable-large-files during configure process. In case of
	disk slice or pre-created file you can use the word 'auto' for size.
	In this case OOPS determines the size ot the file (or the slice) and format it
	using this size.

	<li>offset<br>
	Value of offset will be used as offset for all on-the
	disk structures. This option is required for using slices under
	Solaris/sparc or AIX. Under these sytems, the first sector of the slice
	keeps the volume label which must be preserved.
</ul>

	<li><b>module redir</b><br>
	This section describes how to rewrite or send a new direction of an URL.
	E.g. if you want to filter out the banners, or just want to redirect the
	client to another site this is what you need.

	The parameters:

	<ul>
	<li>file &lt;filename&gt;<br>
	The file that contains the redirection rules (see example redir_rules).
	<li>template &lt;filename&gt;<br>
	This file will be shown to the user if the redir_rules file doesn't
	contain the second column so there is no rule to redirect.
	<li>myport [{hostname|ip_addr}:]port<br>
	If your OOPS runs on several ports and you want to filter on some specific,
	the myport argument is useful. If you use OOPS in transparent proxy
	mode do not use this option.
	<li>mode &lt;rewrite|bounce&gt;<br>
	In the newer verions of OOPS can be 'rewrite' or 'bounce', where
	'rewrite' completely rewrites the URL so it goes directly from the
	cache server without sending the code 302 (Location: xxx.yyy.zzz).
	The "internal" documents (see the redir_rules example file) like the
	nospam1x1 are always sent from the cache.
</ul>
